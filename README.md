# Fake_News_Prediction
Prediction of Fake News using ML algorithm .
I have used logistic regression for this problem .
I have used the natural langugae toolkit (nltk).
I have also used porter stemmer for removing prefixes of words Example : actor, actress, acting------->act(root word).
For encoding i've used Tfidvectorizer .
And at the end i have finally created a predictive system .
